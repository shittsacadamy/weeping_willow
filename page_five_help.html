Somebody, help!" you scream for someone, anyone, to help, and like she was waiting for that call, Mira bursts through the woods and leaps towards the wolves, flames the size of trees burst  through her hands as she lands gracefully a few feet from the wolves. The flames fly over the heads of the beasts and they flea, but just the wind that followed would make you run in terror.</p>
