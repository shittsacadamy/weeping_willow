    <p>While most of the wolves ran in fright, one little straggler stays behind, whimpering and trying to limp away. He stops walking and turns around to lick his leg, but it won't budge. You drop your spell and walk slowly over to him. The puppy whimpers in fear and turns away from you, pulling with all its might to  be let free. Looking down at him, you can see his leg is stuck in a trap, probably set by an inexperienced hunter trying to catch a rabbit. You reach out to  pull him free, but he snaps at you and shivers.</p>
