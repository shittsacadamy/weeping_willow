    <p>The wind stays still, not a single leaf blowing by. The wolves are frozen in mid air mouths in a forever growl. Corvin is standing there, a wolf inches away from his leg. Lifting yourself, one foot at a time you crawl over wolves and tree branches. When you make it to the boy there's a shake, and the wizard, Mira, slowly walks through the brsuh, like somthings stopping her from moving any quicker.</p>
